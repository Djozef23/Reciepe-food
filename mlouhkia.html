<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: rgb(50, 134, 82);font-size:1cm ;"> <br> <b> what You will need: </b> <br> </p>
    <p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align:center;font-size:0.7cm"> Cooking liquid: usually chicken broth or rabbit broth is used. You can use any broth of your choice. <br>
      <br> Frozen Molokhia: in this recipe I've used frozen Molokhia. <br>
      <br> Dry coriander: preferably freshly roasted and ground coriander, the smell is more heavenly. <br>
      <br> Garlic: lots and lots of garlic. Some people like to mince a whole head of garlic. <br> 
      <br>  Ghee: I love using ghee in many recipes, butter is ok as well use oil if you prefer to. <br> 
      <br> Bullion cube: this is to add more flavor to the molokhia, you can skip it if you have none. <br> 
      <br>  Tomato sauce: This is one of the new things I've added to my recipe. It adds a hint of both tartness and sweetness. Some people add sugar some or tomato paste. <br> <br> if you are not used to adding tomatoes to your molokhia feel free to skip this ingredient. <br> 
      <br> Baking soda: this one is to maintain a fresh green look for your Molokhia. <br> <br> This is very helpful if you will be making a big batch of molokhia or you intend to keep it the the fridge for 3 days or so. Feel free to skip. <br> </p>
  
     <h3 style="font-size:1cm; color:green;text-align:center;"> Preparation: </h3> 
  <p style="text-align:center;font-size:0.7cm"><br> <b>1</b> In a deep pot over medium-high heat melt ghee. <br>
      <br> <b>2</b> Saut√© garlic for 15-30 seconds.<br>
      <br> <b>3</b> Until lightly golden and fragrant as shown in picture 3.<br>
      <br> <b>4</b> Add coriander and keep stirring for another 30 seconds.<br>
      <br> <b>5</b> The coriander will give its fragrance and turn a little more dark brown.<br>
      <br> <b>6</b> Pour in some of the broth keeping the rest after we check consistency at the end.<br>
      <br> <b>7</b> Sprinkle the bouillon cube. Stir until it is dissolved.<br>
      <br> <b>8</b> Add the baking soda if you chose to, notice that the broth will foam.<br>
      <br> <b>9</b> Add the Molokhia, and turn down the heat to medium low, keep stirring every now and then.<br>
      <br> <b>10</b> Molokhia will slowly melt in the broth. Wait until it has completely melted.<br>
      <br> <b>11</b> Pour in the tomato sauce and stir well.<br>
      <br> <b>12</b> Check consistency: if it is too thick for your liking add more broth.<br>
      <br> <b>13</b> Check the seasoning and sweetness: if you need salt or more tomato sauce.<br>
      <br> <b>14</b> Serve with rice and pita bread. <br> </p>
